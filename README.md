# Hello-World
My CS50 Repository
I am a recent retiree having worked in the law enforcement arena. I have always been interested in learning more about how computers work and I have now decided to pursue a second career in Cyber Security for individuals, companies and corporations.  I want to learn how to keep my porspective clients and their homes and corporate secrets/intellectual properties safe and secure.
